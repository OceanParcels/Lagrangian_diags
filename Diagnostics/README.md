# List of diagnostics


## Getting started - how this repo works
For each diagnostic we provide a general description in this readme, including information on (i) when (not) to use it, (ii) how to calculate it (there may be different methods/python implementations), (iii) where it has been applied before (i.e. reference to already published papers that make use of the diagnostic), (iv) what could be alternative/ similar diagnostics.
An example application is also given in a complementary jupyter notebook.
The code for the calculation itself is provided as a python function.

## Distance

Methods 
### Mediod
* Method 1 : [mediod_method01.ipynb](mediod_method01.ipynb)
  * When to use it:
    * to identify a representive trajectory of the whole group

### Center of mass displacement
* Method 1 : [center_of_mass_displacement_method01.ipynb](center_of_mass_displacement_method01.ipynb)
  * When to use it:
    * to construct a representive trajectory of the whole group

### Absolute distance (AD)
* Method 1 : [absolute_distance_method01.ipynb](absolute_distance_method01.ipynb)

$$ AD(x,y,t=T) = r(t=T) - r(t=0) $$

### Cumulative distance (CD)
* Method 1 : [cumulative_distance_method01.ipynb](cumulative_distance_method01.ipynb)

$$ CD(x,y,t=T) = r(t=T) - r(t=0) $$

, where $r(t) = f(x,y)$ and is the position of the particle at time, t.  T is the total time period considered for the distance calculation.
