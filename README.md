# Lagrangian_diags

Side-project lead by Siren and Laura to work on Lagrangian diagnostics.
This is WORK IN PROGRESS, EVERYONE IS WELCOME TO CONTRIBUTE!

## Goal of the project
Starting from the general question how to quantify differences in Lagrangian statistics between 
various flow fields, we collect Lagrangian diagnostics commonly used (have a look at this Mindmap and feel free to add 
new info: https://www.mindmeister.com/map/2233459860?t=C9g9yYis4P), and test and compare different methods how to derive 
those diagnostic via python code.

## How to contribute
Given how deeply you want to get involved, we offer 2 options
1. Fork repository and send pull request to main branch
2. Become developer and add changes via developer branch
Please contact us in case you would like to contribute via this option.

### Reminder of how to commit using branches:
The steps you need to do ONLY the first time when you create the branch are in brackets ()

* git init
* git branch [to check in which branch you are]
* (git branch <branch_name>)
* git checkout <branch_name>
* git branch [to verify you are now in the correct branc]
* git add <new_or_changed_file>
* git commit -m "<short_message_on_change>"
* git push origin <branch_name>
* got to https://github.com/OceanParcels/Lagrangian_diags/tree/main and click on pull request to add your pull request (appears at top of page).  You can mention somebody to review your pull request.
